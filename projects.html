                    <p>These are some projects I have worked on throughout my studies as a Computer
                        Science Student. Through these projects I have gained a broader understanding of
                        different aspects of Computer Science and have a more thorough understanding of the
                        importance of Computers and technology in our era.

                        In the TommieCoin Project, which is based off Bitcoin, we were expected to create a wallet where a selection of users
                        could see their balance of TommieCoins, pay TommieCoins to some other user and mine new TommieCoins which will be added to the blockchain.
                        We were expected to create this wallet ourself, while the professor provided a TommieCoin server that
                        our wallet would interact with. The code was written in python, but we used python dictionaries and json to send
                        and gather information to the server. The purpose of this project was to get a better understanding of how
                        Bitcoin works in the background and to get a general understanding of how cryptocurruncies and blockchains work.

                        This project was working with our classes UST-3400 Assembly language. Our
                        previous projects which were Single and Multi-cycle simulators were shown to be inefficient, so the point 
                        of this project was to create a Pipeline simulator that would be able to do 5 seperate steps, these included 
                        Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory and Writeback. While one stage was being used the pipeline could do another task
                        simultanesouly in a different part of the pipeline. This was to increase our throughput and performance drastically
                        for our simulator and to get an understanding of how a pipeline works.

                            In this project we had to create seperate scripts that could break different types of security
                            for passwords. This involved hashed passwords, salted hashed passwords, etc. These programs had to
                            run through massive passwords list and hash and salt them in a way so they could be compared to the 
                            compromised passwords list. The goal of this project was to show the importance of having secure passswords
                            and ways to slow down attackers who may try to use similar scripts.
